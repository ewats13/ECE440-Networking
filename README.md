# ECE440-Networking

This assignment required us to implement TCP server and client functions, and introduce a measure of security. More specifically, a simple substitution cipher to encrypt messages before they are transmitted. On the receiving end, the inverse process will be used to retrieve the original message. One can monitor the communications using Wireshark and observe that the messages transmitted are now encrypted in the data sections of the packets.
